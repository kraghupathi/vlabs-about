** Project Title: Experiment as a Service
   I worked on the Experiment as a Service project. This platform
   gives developers the freedom of authoring the content of the
   Virtual Labs experiments in markup files stored in a Github
   repository. The platform also automatically generates the HTML
   resources from the markup files authored by the Virtual Labs
   developers and hosts them on the production servers.

** Experience: 
   I learnt to work in a professional environment for the first time
   which made my experience a memorable one. I learnt a lot of
   subject matter from the mentors and other interns which helped me
   tremendously in my project.

** Project Title: Data Structures Virtual Lab
   I built experiments for the Data Structures Virtual Lab to improve
   the comprehensibility of the lab for the end users. I implemented
   two experiments - Merge Sort and Quick Sort based on HTML,
   java-script and Dagre-d3 based libraries. I also surveyed and
   documented several technologies such as processing, p5.js etc.

** Experience: 
   My internship experience has been an excellent one. I got to learn
   a lot from my mentor Venkatesh sir. He motivated us all the time
   towards our goals. Apart from my work here, I also interacted with
   Google Hyderabad co-interns from different companies about the
   VLEAD platform which made it a memorable experience.

** Project Title: Conversion of Virtual Labs from Flash to JavaScript
   I converted Virtual Lab experiments from Flash to JavaScript. Hence
   creating similar experiences in JavaScript can benefit us with
   easier understandability, decompilation and re-use of Virtual Labs.


** Experience: 
   I found my internship experience very helpful in enhancing my
   knowledge. The experience made me understand the importance of
   Teamwork and also gain some very important insights of working with
   different domains of people.
