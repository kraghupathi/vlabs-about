*** Project Title: Experiment as a Service
   I worked on the Experiment as a Service project. This platform
   gives developers the freedom of authoring the content of the
   Virtual Labs experiments in markup files stored in a Github
   repository. The platform also automatically generates the HTML
   resources from the markup files authored by the Virtual Labs
   developers and hosts them on the production servers.

*** Experience: 
   I learnt to work in a professional environment for the first time
   which made my experience a memorable one. I learnt a lot of
   subject matter from the mentors and other interns which helped me
   tremendously in my project.

*** Project Title: Data Structures Virtual Lab
   I built experiments for the Data Structures Virtual Lab to improve
   the comprehensibility of the lab for the end users. I implemented
   two experiments - Merge Sort and Quick Sort based on HTML,
   java-script and Dagre-d3 based libraries. I also surveyed and
   documented several technologies such as processing, p5.js etc.

*** Experience: 
   My internship experience has been an excellent one. I got to learn
   a lot from my mentor Venkatesh sir. He motivated us all the time
   towards our goals. Apart from my work here, I also interacted with
   Google Hyderabad co-interns from different companies about the
   VLEAD platform which made it a memorable experience.

*** Project Title: Conversion of Virtual Labs from Flash to JavaScript
   I converted Virtual Lab experiments from Flash to JavaScript. Hence
   creating similar experiences in JavaScript can benefit us with
   easier understandability, decompilation and re-use of Virtual Labs.

*** Experience: 
   I found my internship experience very helpful in enhancing my
   knowledge. The experience made me understand the importance of
   Teamwork and also gain some very important insights of working with
   different domains of people.

*** Project Title:Rebuilding the Linux Lab
    I debugged the code of the existing Linux Lab and now
    the Lab is running fine on Ubuntu 14.04 system. I also
    automated the process of setting the Linux Lab just by
    running an automation script. I also worked on improving
    the experiments for Linux Lab.
*** Experience:  
    I have had a great experience working for VLEAD learning
    a lot from my mentors and instructors. The best part of
    my internship were discussions with my mentor which
    enhanced my skills both technically and professionally
    for future.

*** Project Title:Experiment as a Service
    The project was to build a Virtual Labs Platform which
    can be used to serve the content of experiments. The aim
    was to give freedom of using editors and formats that
    are more flexible to generate content for Virtual Labs.
*** Experience:  
    It was an amazing experience working with VLEAD
    developers. This was my first internship
    experience. Working in a professional environment was
    new to me. Mentors and other interns helped me a lot in
    my project.

*** Project Title: Lab Data Service Dashboard
    Our goal was to minimize the users efforts in accessing
    and manipulating data of Virtual Labs. We developed it
    as an SPA (Single Page Application) and built it from
    the scratch using plain JavaScript without any
    framework.
*** Experience: 
    This is my first internship experience and I strongly
    felt that I have spent quality time here . I got a clear
    idea on how things are dealt at the corporate level. I
    also received tremendous support from all the mentors
    around me. This experience made me understand the
    importance of team work and made me competent to work in
    a professional environment.

*** Project Title:Lab Data Service Dashboard
    The project required us to design a user-friendly
    dashboard for Lab Data Service (LDS) to minimize the
    users efforts in accessing and manipulating data from
    all the Virtual Labs. We developed it as an SPA (Single
    Page Application) just using plain JavaScript without
    any framework along with JSON specification for view
    model which was the most challenging part of all.
*** Experience:  
    This internship experience was exactly like I wanted it
    to be. My understanding of the subject and concepts have
    really grown a lot which is all due to the support of my
    mentors. I think this has really made me compatible to
    work in any professional environment in the future.

*** Project Title: A. Modelling a web application in Alloy
    The first project I worked on was using a specification
    language (like alloy) to model our web application.This
    was done in order to see that all the requirements of
    the application are met and are also correct without
    actually writing the real code.
*** Project Title: B. Modular development of routes in the web application.
    The second project I did was to complete the routes for
    various operations (like addrole,setemail etc totally 12
    of them) modularly so that each module could be used
    independently.


*** Experience:
I have had a great experience working for VLEAD learning
    a lot from my mentors and instructors. The best part of
    my internship were discussions with my mentor which
    enhanced my skills both technically and professionally
    for future.
